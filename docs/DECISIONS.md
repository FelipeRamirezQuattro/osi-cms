# Decisions

One line per non-obvious choice, with the reason. Newest at bottom.

- **Scaffolded on Next.js 16.3.4, not 15.x.** The master prompt asked for
  "15+"; 16 is current stable and satisfies that. Recorded the Next 16
  breaking changes that affect this project in `CLAUDE.md` (`proxy.ts`
  instead of `middleware.ts`, always-async request APIs, `revalidateTag`
  two-arg signature, `cacheComponents` left off).
- **`content/legacy/` in the repo was initially the wrong dataset**
  (Quattro's own agency content, copied by mistake) — replaced with the
  correct Odessa Separator scrape from
  `~/Documents/Work/Quattro/webscrapper/scrape_output_odessaseparator/`
  before Phase 0 work began. Confirmed by URL/title match against the
  master prompt's page list.
- **SG-SST Policies legacy page stays in Spanish** when migrated — it's
  Colombian workplace-safety/harassment regulatory content, not
  translatable UI copy, so the English-only constraint doesn't apply to
  it. Revisit if the client wants an English translation alongside.
- **Supabase project `osi-cms` created fresh** (region `us-east-1`, org
  "Freelancer", free tier) rather than reusing an existing project in the
  account — none of the existing projects (`website`, `Quattro website`,
  `quiz`, `clamp-tracker`) belong to this client.
- **Prettier added alongside ESLint** in Phase 0 (`prettier`,
  `eslint-config-prettier`, `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`) since the
  master prompt's stack table calls for "ESLint/Prettier" explicitly.
- **Vercel project `osi-cms`** created fresh (team `jramirez-3311's
  projects`, project id `prj_uKK9PZKsROFc9AdgSLQWfcIHnQoy`) after the
  first attempt to create a new project hit a 403 — the "claude.ai
  Vercel" connector had been authorized with a restricted token scope.
  Reconnecting the connector fixed it. Did not reuse the pre-existing
  `osi-website` project in the same team — it has an unrelated live
  domain (`chatbot.qdevsolutions.com`) attached.
- **Supabase keys stored in `.env.local` use the new `sb_publishable_*`
  / `sb_secret_*` key format**, not the legacy JWT anon/service_role
  keys — both work interchangeably with `@supabase/ssr` and
  `supabase-js` 2.116+.
- **Added a `status` (draft/published) column to `services`, `industries`,
  `applications`, `locations`, and `directory_contacts`**, none of which
  were specced with one (master prompt §5.3/§5.5). The blanket RLS rule
  in §5.8 ("public SELECT only WHERE status='published'") only works if
  every content table has that column, and `directory_contacts` in
  particular holds real personal phone numbers/emails that need a way to
  stay unpublished until reviewed.
- **Split `is_staff()` and `is_admin()` RLS helpers.** Any active
  `admin_profiles` row passes `is_staff()` (full content CRUD); only
  `role='admin'` passes `is_admin()`, which gates inserting/updating/
  deleting other `admin_profiles` rows — matches open question #8
  ("editor can draft, cannot publish... admin role only" for inviting
  users). Both are intentionally callable by `anon`/`authenticated` (the
  Supabase advisor flags this) since RLS policies evaluate as the
  connecting role — revoking EXECUTE would break every policy that calls
  them.
- **`redirects` is publicly readable** (no status gate) rather than
  restricted to staff/service-role — it's just URL mappings, not
  sensitive, and public read lets the `[slug]` catch-all resolve
  redirects without a service-role client on every request.
- **Consolidated each table's "public read" + "staff manage" (for all)
  policies into one SELECT policy** (`status = 'published' OR
  public.is_staff()`) plus separate staff-only insert/update/delete
  policies, after the Supabase performance advisor flagged 22 tables
  evaluating two permissive policies per query.
- **Seeded only `product_categories` (4) and `industries` (9)** from the
  master prompt's explicit text (§5.1, §5.3) via
  `scripts/seed-taxonomy.ts`, run once against Supabase. `applications`
  and a possible 10th industry ("Gas Control", seen on the mockup's
  Industries tab but not in the prompt's text list) are intentionally
  left unseeded — logged in `docs/CONTENT-GAPS.md` pending client
  confirmation, per constraint 4 (never invent content).
